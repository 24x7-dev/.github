Hey guys glad you found your way here. We are starting our community with programming Discord bots. There are a lot of Youtube, tutorials about various APIs for Node or Py. Unfortunately but hardly anything on Deno and Typescript, I have now made it my goal to create them. The whole thing is done with a relatively new and innovative Discord API wrapper called Discordeno. This is specially designed to handle bots running on a lot of servers thanks to a standalone REST and many other well thought out solutions. Read more here <a href="https://github.com/discordeno/discordeno">Discordeno (v13) Github</a>. || <a href="https://discordeno.mod.land/">Discordeno</a>.

Since there are also no complete guides from starting a bot to hosting the bot and implementing a dashboard. There will also be tutorials on Nuxt3, a web framework that is currently in beta. We will then use this to program the dashboard for our bot. <a href="https://github.com/nuxt/framework">Nuxt Github</a>. || <a href="https://v3.nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt3</a>.
